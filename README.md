# Grail Diary Part 1 - Auto Layout

A student that completes this project shows that they can:

- understand and explain what Auto Layout is, and the problems it solves
- implement common layouts using constraints in Interface Builder
- implement common layouts using UIStackView

## Introduction

Grail Diary is an app that allows the user to track locations of interest (POIs) and useful clues about those locations.

## Instructions

Please fork and clone this repository. Create a new Xcode project inside of the cloned repository. Use the single view app template and name it "GrailDiary"

### Storyboard Tasks

#### List of Clues View
1. Rename the View Controller to `POIsTableViewController` with the refactor->rename option in the source code file. To do this, right click on the class called `ViewController` and a contextual menu will appear. Select "Refactor", then "Rename..." and type the new class name.
2. Embed the single View Controller scene in a Navigation Controller
3. Drag in a Table View to that View Controller
4. Set the navigation bar to show large titles
5. Give the View Controller scene a title of "Grail Diary"
6. Add constraints with margins disabled to the Table View:
    * Top = `0`
    * Leading = `0`
    * Trailing = `0`
    * Bottom = `0`
7. Set the Table View to show 1 prototype cell (select the Table View and look in the attributes inspector); set the prototype cell identifier to "POICell"
8. Set the Table View to show 60 pt rows (row height in the Table View's size inspector)
9. Drag 3 labels into the cell prototype
10. Give one a text value of `"Location"`, one `"Country"`, and the last one `"# of clues"`
11. Change the text styles for the three labels to emphasize the location primarily
12. Select the location and country labels and embed them in a vertical Stack View
13. Use the following attributes for the Stack View:
    * an alignment of `leading`
    * a distribution of `fill`
    * spacing = `2`
14. Add the following constraints to the Stack View:
    * vertical centering in the container (cell)
    * margin-based leading = `0`
15. Add the following constraints to the clues label:
    * vertical centering in the container (cell)
    * margin-based trailing = `0`
16. Add a constraint between the Stack View and the clues label with these attributes:
    * horizontal spacing
    * change the relationship to `>=`
    * constant = `8`
17. Add a bar button item to the right side of the navigation bar and set the system item value to "Add"

#### Add New POI View
18. Drag a View Controller scene onto the canvas
19. Control-click from the add bar button item in the list of clues view to the new scene; choose "present modally" for the segue kind and use "AddPOIModalSegue" for the identifier
20. Drag 5 text fields into the new View Controller scene; use these placeholders: "Location", "Country", "Clue 1", "Clue 2", "Clue 3"
21. Place the 5 text fields into a vertical Stack View with the following Stack View attributes:
    * `fill` for both alignment and distribution
    * spacing = `16`
22. Add the following constraints to the Stack View:
    * leading = `20`
    * trailing = `20`
    * top = `20`
23. Insert a label into the top of the Stack View and give it a value of "New POI"; set the font text style to "Large Title"
24. Insert a label above the first clue Text Field in the Stack View and give it a value of "Clues"; set the font text style to "Headline"
25. Add a toolbar to the bottom of the scene
26. Constrain the toolbar to the view with the following:
    * leading = `0`
    * trailing = `0`
    * bottom = `0`
27. Add 3 bar button items: 1 set to "cancel", 1 to "flexible space", and 1 to "save"; this should separate the two buttons to the left and right edges

#### POI Detail View
28. Drag in a View Controller scene to the canvas
29. Control-drag from the location cell to the new scene; select "show" for the segue kind and enter "ShowPOIDetailSegue" for the identifier
30. Drag 3 labels into the new scene
31. Set one to "Location Name" and use the following constraints:
    * top = `20`
    * trailing = `20`
32. Place another label below that and set it to "Country"; control-drag from this label to the location name label above and add these constraints:
    * trailing alignment (trailing edges of both labels are aligned)
    * vertical spacing = `8`
33. Drag an Image View into the scene
34. Constrain it with the following:
    * `1:1` aspect ratio (check the box and then edit the value to make it 1:1)
    * width = `150`
    * leading = `20`
    * using a constraint, align the top of the image with the top of the location name label
35. Find a square image of an interesting location on Google and drag it into your asset catalog; set a sensible name and set the name as the image in the Image View attributes
36. Add a horizontal distance constraint between the location label and the Image View
    * set the constant value to `8`
    * make it a `>=` constraint
37. Add a horizontal distance constraint between the country label and the Image View
    * set the constant value to `8`
    * make it a `>=` constraint
38. Place the third label below; set the value to "Clues"; use the following constraints:
    * align the leading with the Image View
    * set a top distance to the Image View = `40`
39. Drag a text view into the canvas
40. Constrain it below the clues label with the following:
    * leading alignment with clues label
    * vertical distance of `8`
    * relate the text view and the "Country" label by aligning their trailing values
    * bottom to view = `20`

# Grail Diary Part 2 - Delegates and Protocols

A student that completes this project shows that they can:

- understand and explain what a protocol is and common scenarios for their use
- define a custom protocol, and make a class or struct conform to it
- understand and explain the purpose of UITableViewController
- use a regular UIViewController to display a UITableView
- create a custom UITableViewCell
- understand and explain the delegate pattern and why it is used

## Introduction

Grail Diary is an app that allows the user to track locations of interest (POIs) and useful facts about those locations.

## Instructions

Please use the same repository you used yesterday for Grail Diary Part 1. If you've created a PR to submit your work, you'll continue to use the same PR. New commits will automatically be added to that PR. Just submit the same link again at the end of this assignment.

### File Tasks

1. Create a new file using the Cocoa Touch Class template; call it `AddPOIViewController` and make it a subclass of `UIViewController`
2. Create one more Cocoa Touch Class in the same way called `POIDetailViewController` (also subclassed from `UIViewController`).
3. Create another Cocoa Touch Class subclassed from `UITableViewCell` called `POITableViewCell`
4. Create a Swift file called `POI` (this is your model)

### Storyboard Tasks

5. Set the custom class for each view controller scene in the storyboard to match the names of the files you just created

### Code Tasks

#### In `POI.swift`:

6. Create a `struct` called `POI` that models 3 properties: `location`, `country`, and `clues`; the data types are `String`, `String`, and an array of `String` objects

#### In `POIsTableViewController.swift`:

7. Create an array property to store your `POI` models
8. Create an `IBOutlet` to link the table view to your code; wire up this outlet to the table view in the storyboard. This is necessary because we are using a table view in a normal `UIViewController`.
9. In an extension, make this class conform to the `UITableViewDataSource` protocol
10. Implement the following protocol methods: `tableView(_:numberOfRowsInSection:)` and `tableView(_:cellForRowAt:indexPath:)`
11. Set the view controller as the delegate and data source for the table view.

#### In `AddPOIViewController.swift`:

12. Declare `IBOutlet` properties for the 5 textfields in this view; wire these up to their appropriate textfields in the storyboard
13. Declare a protocol above this class in the same file called `AddPOIDelegate`; declare a single function requirement called `poiWasAdded(_ poi: POI)`
14. Declare a variable property called `delegate` of type `AddPOIDelegate` and make it optional
15. Create 2 `IBAction` methods: `cancelTapped(_ sender: UIBarButtonItem)`, and `saveTapped(_ sender: UIBarButtonItem)`; wire them up to their appropriate bar button items in the storyboard
16. Inside `cancelTapped`, simply dismiss this view as the user has indicated they want to leave this screen
17. Inside `saveTapped`, guard unwrap the text inside the location and country textfields, initialize a `POI` object, and then if-let unwrap the 3 clue textfields and add them to the POI if applicable
18. At the end of the `saveTapped` method, call the delegate method on the delegate property and pass the POI that was just created as an argument
19. In an extension, make the class conform to the `UITextFieldDelegate` protocol
20. In the storyboard, for each textfield in this view, connect the delegate property of the textfield to this class
21. Implement the delegate method `textFieldShouldReturn(_:)`; unwrap the text and make sure it's not empty, then `switch` off the textfield to determine which one called this method; change the `firstResponder` status to the appropriate textfield

#### In `POIsTableViewController.swift`:

22. In an extension, make the class conform to the `AddPOIDelegate` protocol
23. Implement the delegate method `poiWasCreated(_:)`
24. Append the poi that was passed into the method to your array
25. Dismiss the view so the modal animates offscreen
26. Reload the tableview's data
27. In the main class definition, implement the `prepare(for:sender:)` method (it might be commented out)
28. Check the identifier of the segue first; look for the identifier `AddPOIModalSegue`
29. If that identifier is found, use the segue object's `destination` property to grab the view controller we're transitioning to and cast it as an instance of `AddPOIViewController`; you'll need to unwrap this as the cast may not succeed
30. If the unwrap is successful, use the view controller you unwrapped, set its `delegate` property to `self`; this ensures the `POIsTableViewController` will act on behalf of the `AddPOIViewController`

#### In `POITableViewCell.swift`:

31. Declare `IBOutlet` properties for the following cell elements: `locationLabel`, `countryLabel`, and `cluesCountLabel`; connect them to their appropriate labels in the storyboard
32. Declare an optional property called `poi` of type `POI`; add a `didSet` observer that calls a function named `updateViews`
33. Define a private function named `updateViews`; inside, unwrap `poi` and use its properties to populate the various labels with data

#### In `POIDetailViewController.swift`:

34. Declare 3 `IBOutlet` properties: `locationLabel`, `countryLabel`, and `cluesTextView` using `UILabel` and `UITextView` for the types; wire them to their appropriate subviews in the storyboard
35. Declare a variable property called `poi` of type `POI`
36. Create a private method called `updateViews` that takes no arguments
37. Call the above method inside `viewDidLoad`
38. In `updateViews`, unwrap the poi property with `guard` and set the various model properties to the text of the labels and the textview; you'll have to do a little formatting to show the clues as a list in the `cluesTextView`

#### In `POIsTableViewController.swift`:

39. In the `prepare(for:sender:)` method, add an `else-if` to your existing code to check for a different segue identifier, `ShowPOIDetailSegue`
40. If that identifier is found, unwrap the selected row's index path from the tableview, and then grab the segue's destination view controller and cast it as an instance of `POIDetailViewController` (do these two steps together in a compound `if-let`)
41. If those unwraps are successful, set the detail view controller's `poi` property to the appropriate `POI` from the array you use in this class to track all POIs

### Testing

At this point, the app should run and allow new POIs to be entered. They should appear in the main tableview and when tapped, the app should transition to a detail view to show the rest of the information about each POI.
